                    Hello! I'm Ryan Kennedy a second year student at Northeastern University pursuing a Bachelors of
                    Science in Computer Science with a
                    concentration in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I am currently teaching myself HTML /
                    CSS and hoping to get
                    experience with front-end development so I hope that this website stands as a showcase of my current
                    progress in learning web development.

                    Developed a Java based program which reads given textual input and displays the described animation,
                    offering a UI with features allowing
                    playing, pausing, looping, and restarting of the animation, and a pannel which allows the user to
                    create shapes and also edit specific frames
                    of the shapes as the animation is playing. Also includes the functionality to output these
                    animations to either a textual output or a SVG graphical output.

                <p class="website-description">
                    Developed a Processing based program which allows the user to watch a maze be generated following a
                    depth-first generation algorithm, where
                    once fully generated allows the user to place cheese throughout the maze, in turn spawning mice to
                    solve the maze and then bring the cheese
                    outside of the maze. Utilizes an A* path-finding algorithm for the mice to solve the maze in the
                    most efficient way possible.

                    of collecting the necessary car parts to escape the map. The user must fight off bears attempting to
